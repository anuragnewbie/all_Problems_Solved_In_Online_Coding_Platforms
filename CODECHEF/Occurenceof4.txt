Q5) Impressed by the power of this number, Kostya has begun to look for occurrences of four anywhere. He has a list of T integers, for each of them he wants to calculate the number of occurrences of the digit 4 in the decimal representation. He is too busy now, so please help him.

Input
The first line of input consists of a single integer T, denoting the number of integers in Kostya's list.

Then, there are T lines, each of them contain a single integer from the list.

Output
Output T lines. Each of these lines should contain the number of occurences of the digit 4 in the respective integer from Kostya's list.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 105
(Subtask 1): 0 ≤ Numbers from the list ≤ 9 - 33 points.
(Subtask 2): 0 ≤ Numbers from the list ≤ 109 - 67 points.
Example
Input:
5
447474
228
6664
40
81

Output:
4
0
1
1
0


A5) Solution is -->
import java.lang.*;
import java.io.*;

class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
	    BufferedReader b = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
       
        try {
            long t = Long.parseLong(b.readLine());
       
            while(t-- > 0){
                String s = b.readLine();
                int count=0;
            
                for(int i=0; i<s.length(); i++)
                    count = (s.charAt(i)== '4') ? ++count : count;
                
                System.out.println(count);
            }
        } catch(Exception e) {}
	}
}
