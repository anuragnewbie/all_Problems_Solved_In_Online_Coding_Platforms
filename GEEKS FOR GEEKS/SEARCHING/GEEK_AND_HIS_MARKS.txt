Q) There are N students in a class. Each student got arr[i] (1 <= i <= N) marks in mathematics exam. Geek loves mathematics, so, he wanted to solve the questions. And he got X marks. And now geek is curious to know, how many students are there in the class who got marks greater than geek's

Input:
1. The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
2. The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and X.
3. The second line contains N space-separated positive integers represents array arr.

Output: For each test case, print the count of students who got marks greater than X

Example:
Input:
2
3 2
4 1 3
4 9
4 8 1 2

Output:
2
0
