Q3)You have been given an array A of size N consisting of positive integers. You need to find and print the product of all the number in this array Modulo 10(to the power of 9) + 7.

Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer N denoting the size of the array. The next line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of the array

Output Format:
Print a single integer denoting the product of all the elements of the array Modulo 10(to the power of 9) + 7.

Explanation
There are 5 integers to multiply. Let's store the final answer in  variable. Since 1 is identity value for multiplication, initialize  as 1.

5                                         
1 2 3 4 5      

So the process goes as follows:

answer=1
answer=(answer*1) % (10(to the power of 9)+7) 
answer=(answer*2) % (10(to the power of 9)+7) 
answer=(answer*3) % (10(to the power of 9)+7) 
answer=(answer*4) % (10(to the power of 9)+7) 
answer=(answer*5) % (10(to the power of 9)+7) 

The above process will yield answer as 
120

A3) ->

#include<stdio.h>
#include<math.h>

void main()
{
	long int n, i, answer=1;
	
	scanf("%ld", &n);

	long int arr[n];

	for(i=0; i<n; i++)
		scanf("%ld", &arr[i]);

	for(i=0; i<n; i++)
		answer = (answer*arr[i])%((int)(pow(10, 9)+7));

	printf("%ld", answer);
}
